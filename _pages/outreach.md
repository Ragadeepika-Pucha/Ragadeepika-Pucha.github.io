In addition to being a researcher, I aim to be a good mentor to future researchers and a strong advocate for accessible education, irrespective of one's identity, position, and privilege. Below are some of the outreach activities that I have been involved in the past few years. </p>

## Science as a Career

I am really interested in developing enthusiasm in kids regarding science. I believe that every child is born a scientist - it is just the effort to nurture those curiosities that is required. I want to help create a difference in making children realize their potential - especially, in recognizing that there are many other fields apart from Engineering and Medicine, where a career can be established. Scientific career is something that I want to promote. <br/><br/>

I have given several in-person and virtual presentations for a variety of public groups, with the aim of developing enthusiasm for astronomy and research. One such talk is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXhPQtqK_ks&pp=ygURcmFnYWRlZXBpa2EgcHVjaGE%3D">here</a>. <br/> <br/>

Feel free to contact me for any speaking requests or for ways to connect. </p>

## Project Bharati

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
I strongly believe that research should be accessible to everyone, irrespective of the position they hold. Many undergraduate students throughout the world do not have access to hands-on research experience before they apply for the graduate programs. For this purpose, I started an initiative, *Project Bharati*, with the aim of helping students find ways and resources to get started with scientific research. The goal is help students get a sense of how research works and to develop a skillset that will contribute to their future.

Under this umbrella, I have four mentees at the moment who are interested in pursuing astronomy research. I have regular virtual classes for them, where I teach basics of astronomy as well as some basic astronomy-research tools such as python, SQL, etc, that are required for astronomy research. I help them develop their CV and also motivate them to apply for various summer internships. I am currently advising one of the students on an astronomy-based project using publicly available data. 

Feel free to contact me if you want to learn about pursuing scientific research.

## Interviews 

* I had the honor of being interviewed by [STEMM4Girls](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stemm4girls), a student-led initiative that advocates for the advancement of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Medicine (STEMM) education for girls. In the [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp8KxYbb3kA&pp=ygURcmFnYWRlZXBpa2EgcHVjaGE%3D), I shared my journey in research and the insights I have gained along the way.
