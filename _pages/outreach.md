In addition to being a researcher, I aim to be a good mentor to future researchers and a strong advocate for accessible education, irrespective of one's identity, position, and privilege. Below are some outreach activities that I have been involved in the past few years. </p>

## Science as a Career

I am really interested in developing enthusiasm in kids regarding science. I believe that every child is born a scientist - it is just the effort to nurture those curiosities that is required. I want to help create a difference in making children realize their potential - especially, in recognizing that there are many other fields apart from Engineering and Medicine, where a career can be established. Scientific career is something that I want to promote. <br/><br/>

I have given several in-person and virtual presentations for a variety of public groups, with the aim of developing enthusiasm for astronomy and research. One such talk is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXhPQtqK_ks&pp=ygURcmFnYWRlZXBpa2EgcHVjaGE%3D">here</a>. <br/> <br/>

Feel free to contact me for any speaking requests or for ways to connect. </p>
