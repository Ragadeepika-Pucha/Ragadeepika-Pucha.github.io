Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah, working with [Prof. Yao-Yuan Mao](https://yymao.github.io/). I am primarily interested in understanding the formation and evolution of low-mass "dwarf" galaxies using observational techniques. My broader research interests include Galaxy Formation and Evolution, Observational Astronomy, Dwarf Galaxies, Satellite Galaxies, Active Galactic Nuclei, Intermediate-Mass Black Holes, Supermassive Black Holes, and Lyman Alpha Emitters.

I was born in [Hyderabad, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad), and grew up in several cities around the country. I completed my Integrated M.Sc (Physics) from [Visva-Bharati University](https://www.visvabharati.ac.in/index.html), West Bengal, India, where I was a [DST-INSPIRE](https://online-inspire.gov.in/) scholar for the entire period of five years (2010 - 2015). I then completed my Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Arizona in 2023 under the guidance of [Dr. St√©phanie Juneau](https://stephjuneau.github.io/) and [Dr. Arjun Dey](https://arjundeyastro.wordpress.com/). My thesis work ("[Dwarf Galaxies as Probes of Galaxy Evolution](https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/669820)") focused on answering several key questions in galaxy evolution using low-mass galaxies.
