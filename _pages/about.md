Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah, working with <a href="https://yymao.github.io/">Prof. Yao-Yuan Mao</a>. My primary research focuses on understanding the formation and evolution of low-mass "dwarf" galaxies through observational techniques. I am broadly interested in various aspects of galaxy evolution including topics such as Active Galactic Nuclei, Intermediate-Mass Black Holes, Supermassive Black Holes, Satellite Galaxies, and Lyman-Alpha Emitters. <br/><br/>

I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad">Hyderabad, India</a>, and grew up in several cities around the country. I completed my Integrated M.Sc (Physics) at <a href="https://www.visvabharati.ac.in/index.html">Visva-Bharati University</a>, West Bengal, India, where I was a <a href="https://online-inspire.gov.in/">DST-INSPIRE</a> scholar for the entire period of five years (2010 - 2015). After that, I earned my Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics from the University of Arizona in 2023, under the guidance of <a href="https://stephjuneau.github.io/">Dr. St√©phanie Juneau</a> and <a href="https://arjundeyastro.wordpress.com/">Dr. Arjun Dey</a>. My thesis work, titled "<a href="https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/669820">Dwarf Galaxies as Probes of Galaxy Evolution</a>
", focused on answering several key questions in galaxy evolution using low-mass galaxies. You can learn more about my work <a href="http://ragadeepika-pucha.github.io/research/">here</a>.
