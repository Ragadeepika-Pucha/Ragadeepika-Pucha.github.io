My research focuses on understanding how low-mass "dwarf" galaxies form and evolve in the Universe. Dwarf galaxies are the most abundant galaxies in the Universe, yet they remain poorly understood. What are their evolutionary histories? Do they follow the same path as massive galaxies? Do they have black holes? If yes, how do these black holes and the galaxies grow together? I use multi-wavelength observations of dwarf galaxies to answer such key questions in galactic astronomy.


Dwarf galaxies are considered to be building blocks of larger, more massive galaxies such as our own Milky Way. Understanding the growth of dwarf galaxies at different epochs of the Universe. I detail my current and past research below. 

## Past Research

### [Lyα Escape is Efficient in Compact Star-Forming Galaxies with Low Gravitational Potential](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..159P/abstract)

Lyman-Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are faint low-mass, star-forming galaxies at high redshifts (larger distances), and they are mainly identified based on their strong Lyα emission. However, Lyα photons are resonant in nature, meaning they interact repeatedly with any available neutral hydrogen atoms, and it is unclear how they manage to escape from galaxies.  Understanding how Lyα escapes helps us learn more about the distribution of gas and dust in galaxies, and how stellar processes contribute to the escape of ionizing photons from low-mass galaxies. We used multi-wavelength observations from the Subaru telescope and the Hubble Space telescope to study the faintest LAEs at a redshift, z ≈ 2.65, and compared them with typical star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 2-3. Our results suggest that the compact shapes of low-mass galaxies can lead to conditions that makes in easier for Lyα photons to escape. This research offers insights into the processes that led to the reionization of the universe and connects to studies of primordial galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope.


### [Evidence of Hierarchical Accretion in a Dwarf Irregular Galaxy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...880..104P/abstract)

One of the key questions about dwarf galaxies is how they are built and what shapes them. Studying the resolved stars in the faint outer parts of these galaxies is crucial for understanding how they formed - whether it is from their own internal processes or from merging with other smaller galaxies. Using the Subaru telescope, we conducted the widest and deepest survey of resolved stellar populations in a nearby dwarf galaxy, IC1613, to explore the structure of its outer regions. We found some evidence of accretion, in accretion to a stellar component from a possible stellar feedback event. This pioneering study lays the foundation for future wide-field studies of low-mass galaxies, especially with the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory.
