My research focuses on understanding how low-mass "dwarf" galaxies form and evolve in the Universe. Dwarf galaxies are the most abundant galaxies in the Universe, yet they remain poorly understood. What are their evolutionary histories? Do they follow the same path as massive galaxies? Do they have black holes? If yes, how do these black holes and the galaxies grow together? I use multi-wavelength observations of dwarf galaxies to answer such key questions in galactic astronomy.


Dwarf galaxies are considered to be building blocks of larger, more massive galaxies such as our own Milky Way. Understanding the growth of dwarf galaxies at different epochs of the Universe. I detail my current and past research below. 

## Past Research

### Evidence of Hierarchical Accretion in a Dwarf Irregular Galaxy

One of the key questions about dwarf galaxies is how they are built and what shapes them. Studying the resolved stars in the faint outer parts of these galaxies is crucial for understanding how they formed - whether it is from their own internal processes or from merging with other smaller galaxies. Using the Subaru telescope, we conducted the widest and deepest survey of resolved stellar populations in a nearby dwarf galaxy, IC1613, to explore the structure of its outer regions. We found some evidence of accretion, in accretion to a stellar component from a possible stellar feedback event. This pioneering study lays the foundation for future wide-field studies of low-mass galaxies, especially with the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory.
