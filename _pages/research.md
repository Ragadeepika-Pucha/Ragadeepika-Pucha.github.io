My research focuses on understanding how low-mass "dwarf" galaxies form and evolve in the Universe. Dwarf galaxies are the most abundant galaxies in the Universe, yet they remain poorly understood. What are their evolutionary histories? Do they follow the same path as massive galaxies? Do they have black holes? If yes, how do these black holes and the galaxies grow together? I use multi-wavelength observations of dwarf galaxies to answer such key questions in galactic astronomy.


Dwarf galaxies are considered to be building blocks of larger, more massive galaxies such as our own Milky Way. Understanding the growth of dwarf galaxies at different epochs of the Universe. I detail my current and past research below. 

## Past Research

### Evidence of Hierarchical Accretion in a Dwarf Irregular Galaxy

| <img align="left" src="http://ragadeepika-pucha.github.io/images/ic1613.jpg" width="1000"/> | One of the key questions related to dwarf galaxies is how they are structured and formed. Mapping the resolved stellar populations in the faint outer regions is pivotal for disentangling the structure formation scenarios in low-mass galaxies - whether they are formed by internal processes or by hierarchical accretion. We used the Subaru telescope to conduct the widest and deepest survey of resolved stellar populations in a local group dwarf galaxy, IC 1613, to understand the structure of its outer regions. We found evidence of accretion, in addition to an in-situ component from a possible stellar feedback event. This pioneering study provides a starting point for future detailed wide-field studies of low-mass galaxies with the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory.
